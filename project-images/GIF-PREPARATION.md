# Optimizing GIFs for Project Showcase

Animated GIFs can make your project showcase significantly more engaging by demonstrating functionality in action rather than relying on static images. Follow these recommendations for best results:

## Guidelines for Project GIFs

1. **Keep File Size Manageable**
   - Aim for under 1MB when possible to prevent slow page loading
   - Consider using video formats converted to GIF for better compression

2. **Optimize Dimensions**
   - Recommended width: 800-1200px
   - Aspect ratio: 16:9 or 3:2 works best with the layout

3. **Frame Rate & Duration**
   - 15-20 FPS is sufficient for most demonstrations
   - Keep duration between 3-8 seconds for best performance
   - If demonstrating a longer process, consider creating a loop of the key moments

4. **Color Optimization**
   - Reduce the color palette to lower file size
   - Avoid rapid color changes which increase file size dramatically

## Tools for Creating Optimized GIFs

- **ScreenToGif** (Windows): Great for recording screen demos
- **GIMP** or **Photoshop**: For editing and optimizing existing GIFs
- **EZGif.com**: Web-based optimizer for existing GIFs
- **FFmpeg**: Command-line conversion from video to optimized GIF

## Example Command for Creating Optimized GIFs from Video

```bash
# Using FFmpeg to convert video to optimized GIF
ffmpeg -i input-video.mp4 -vf "fps=15,scale=800:-1:flags=lanczos,split[s0][s1];[s0]palettegen[p];[s1][p]paletteuse" -loop 0 output.gif
```
