# Project Images

Place your project images in this directory with the following names:
- background-removal.jpg - For the AI Background Removal project
- volunteer-agent.jpg - For the Conversational Agent for Volunteering project
- stock-management.jpg - For the Next-Gen UX for Stock Management project

Images will be displayed with a minimum height of 500px for regular images and animated GIFs to ensure good visibility on the project cards. The project cards now alternate between left and right alignment for a visually dynamic layout.
